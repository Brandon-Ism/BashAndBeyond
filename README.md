It (aims to) include a wide range of scripts and tutorials that cover everything from basic commands to complex automation tasks, providing a comprehensive learning experience. The goal is to not only enhance practical skills but also to document and showcase my learning journey as I prepare to apply to graduate programs in Computer Science. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, I hope you find these resources both informative and instrumental in your own scripting endeavors.
